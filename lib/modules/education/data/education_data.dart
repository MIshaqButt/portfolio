    projectName: "PEDESTRIAN DETECTION IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICELS USING DEEP LEARNING",
    projectDescription: "Pedestrian detection using deep learning is a pivotal research area in computer vision, with profound implications for autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and pedestrian safety. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this study explores the automatic extraction of highly discriminative features from raw image data, revolutionizing object detection. CNNs have emerged as the cornerstone for pedestrian detection, offering state-of-the-art performance across various vision-based applications, including object recognition, security monitoring, and autonomous vehicles. The research utilizes multi-camera video data and frame-based analysis to achieve advanced pedestrian recognition, significantly contributing to the high-performance standards of autonomous vehicle systems."
