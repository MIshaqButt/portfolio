      projectDescription: '''Your dreams are a conversation with your subconscious, a direct line to your deepest thoughts and emotions. But how do you learn the language? DreamyBot is your quiet companion for that journey. We are a first-of-its-kind emotional wellness tool designed to help you turn dream analysis into a meaningful, accessible practice of intentional self-reflection. Our conversational AI engages you in a thoughtful dialogue, guiding you toward personal insights in a way that feels natural, supportive, and completely private. Over 100k+ people have used DreamyBot to find clarity, navigate anxiety, and foster genuine emotional growth. The experience is consistently described as "spot-on," "life-changing" and "transformative."
Your Toolkit for Self-Discovery:
DreamyBot Remembers: Save your dream discussions in a private log and allow DreamyBot to recall past entries. Discover connections across your subconscious landscape and receive insights that grow more personalized and attuned to you over time. You are always in control of what is remembered.
1. Your Personal Symbology: Go beyond a single interpretation. DreamyBot automatically identifies key themes, emotional tones, and recurring symbols from your conversations, building an evolving, personal dream dictionary that is entirely unique to your mind.
2. Actionable Clarity: Receive a concise summary after each dream discussion, complete with tailored reflection prompts and a suggested action to integrate your insights into your waking life. This is how reflection becomes growth.
3. A Space for All Your Thoughts: Your mind is always active. Our new General Discussion mode provides a separate, dedicated space to reflect on daily thoughts, anxieties, or ideas with the same quiet, conversational support you trust.
4. A Seamless Mobile Experience: Our new mobile interface is beautiful, intuitive, and effortless to use, ensuring nothing gets in the way of your reflection practice.''',
